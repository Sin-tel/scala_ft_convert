This tool converts scala files (.scl) to 0CC famitracker detune settings (.csv).
You can download scala here to generate scl files: http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/downloads.html
You can also just edit/make scala files in notepad. Take a look at the examples to figure out how it works.

The .csv files can be imported in 0CC via Module> Detune settings...> Import

This requires Lua 5 and Love2d to work.
